Contact nbranchini17@gmail.com for questions. 

Running the code requires installing Emukit (latest version should work), graphviz and pygraphviz. 
I recommend installing the above in that order, based on experience on Mac OS - Graphviz can be a pain.
Remaining packages are standard and any recent version should work.
