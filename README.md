Contact nbranchini17@gmail.com for questions. 

Running the code requires installing Emukit (latest version should work), graphviz and pygraphviz. 
I recommend installing the above in that order, based on experience on Mac OS - Graphviz can be a pain.
Remaining packages are standard and any recent version should work. 

There is a lot of functionality inherited from DCBO (https://github.com/neildhir/DCBO), which the code was built upon, that is not used.

Finally, this is research code. We are not professional software developers and are thus not equipped to make a (more) robust implementation.
Email the first author for questions on the code.
